# Programming guidelines
## Summer game dev '18 - Team 1
> For unity + GitHub integration use official GitHub plugin [HERE](https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/version-control/github-for-unity-118069)
> **UPDATE GITHUB PLUGIN IF AVAILABLE**
> The plugin has to be imported into project as an asset (automatic via assets store)


+ For every new feature create a new branch explaining the functionality
+ When working on a new feature, don't edit **stable** scenes, create a new one
